# Inherit from this class for FXML controllers
class JRubyFX::Controller
  include JRubyFX::Control

  # Controllers usually need access to the stage.
  attr_accessor :stage

  ##
  # Construction as a Java Class
  ##

  # Load given fxml file onto the given stage. `settings` is an optional hash of:
  # * :initialize => [array of arguments to pass to the initialize function]
  # * :width => Default width of the Scene
  # * :height => Default height of the Scene
  # * :fill => Fill color of the Scene's background
  # * :depth_buffer => JavaFX Scene DepthBuffer argument (look it up)
  # * :relative_to =>  filename search for fxml realtive to this file
  #
  # === Examples
  #
  #   controller = MyFXController.new "Demo.fxml", stage
  #
  # === Equivalent Java
  #   Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("Demo.fxml"));
  #   Scene scene = new Scene(root);
  #   stage.setScene(scene);
  #   controller = root.getController();

  def self.new(filename, stage, settings={})
    # Inherit from default settings
    settings = @@default_settings.merge settings

    # Magic self-java-ifying new call. (Creates a Java instance from our ruby)
    become_java!

    # like new, without initialize
    ctrl = allocate

    # Set the stage so we can reference it if needed later
    ctrl.stage = stage

    # load the FXML file
    root = Control.get_fxml_loader(filename, ctrl, settings[:relative_to]).load

    # Unless the FXML root node is a scene, wrap that node in a scene
    if root.is_a? Scene
      scene = root
    else
      scene = Scene.new root, settings[:width], settings[:height], settings[:depth_buffer]
      scene.fill = settings[:fill]
    end

    # set the controller and stage scene
    ctrl.scene = stage.scene = scene

    # finish init and return
    ctrl.initialize_controller *settings[:initialize].to_a
  end

  # Full list of mappings:
  # fx_key_handler is for KeyEvent
  # fx_mouse_handler is for MouseEvent
  # fx_touch_handler is for TouchEvent
  # fx_gesture_handler is for GestureEvent
  # fx_context_handler is for ContextMenuEvent
  # fx_context_menu_handler is for ContextMenuEvent
  # fx_drag_handler is for DragEvent
  # fx_ime_handler is for InputMethodEvent
  # fx_input_method_handler is for InputMethodEvent
  # fx_window_handler is for WindowEvent
  # fx_action_handler is for ActionEvent
  # fx_generic_handler is for Event
  # 
  # And if you need a custom Event, you can use:
  # fx_handler :name, YourCustomEvent do |e| ... end
